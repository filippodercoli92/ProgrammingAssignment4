Variables introduced or modified in the script:
- trainData: data frame containing the reading from file "X_train".
- trainLabel: data frame containing the reading from file "y_train".
- trainSub: data frame containing the reading from file "subject_train".
- testData: data frame containing the reading from file "X_test".
- testLabel: data frame containing the reading from file "y_test".
- testSub: data frame containing the reading from file "subject_train".
- set: variable describing the origin of the observation. It has 2 values: "Train" and "Test". 
- fullTrain: data frame created from the binding of trainLabel, trainSub, set and trainData.
- fullTest: data frame created from the binding of testLabel, testSub, set and testData.
- activity_id: name given to the column "...Label" containing the numeric activity label; later modified with the full name of the 
  activities.
- subject_id:name given to the column "...Label" containing the numeric subject label.
- contT1, contT2, contF1, contF2: are counters to extract the mean and std. deviations variables for each measurement.
- smallTrain: is a selection from fullTrain. It contains the columns activity_id, subject_id, set and the mean and std. deviations 
  variables for each measurement.
- smallTest: is a selection from fullTest. It contains the columns activity_id, subject_id, set and the mean and std. deviations 
  variables for each measurement.
- mergedSmall: data frame obtained row binding smallTrain and smallTest. The measurement variable are given an appropriate name and 
  activity ids modified.
- mergedSmallGroup: mergedSmall grouped by activity_id and subject_id.
- summary: data frame containing the mean of each numeric variable for each activity and subject.
